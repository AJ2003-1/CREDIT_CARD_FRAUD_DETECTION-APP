# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – Flask Web Application

This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. It uses a trained Random Forest Classifier model along with a StandardScaler, both deployed using Flask. The web interface allows users to enter transaction details and instantly get a prediction on whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.
